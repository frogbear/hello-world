Hello Dearest Reader,

I write to you today in a state of sadness that will perpetually brew. For I will never feel the sand between my toes do to those savage penguins. Their sharp squawks and revelation of the thundering stampede that insued will haunt my dreams for eternity.

Dearest Regards,
Toeless Pete Fiordland
